        <h2>AI Safety and Responsible AI in Humanitarian Contexts: A Global Policy Brief</h2>
        <h3>Introduction: AI in Humanitarian Settings (Scope and Importance)</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a key tool in humanitarian operations worldwide. Humanitarian agencies are applying AI across a range of crisis contexts – from natural disaster relief and public health emergencies to refugee support and conflict response – to enhance the speed and effectiveness of aid delivery<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. For example, AI-driven systems can help predict impending disasters, optimize resource allocation (like food or medical supply distribution), and improve service delivery in hard-to-reach areas<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. In settings where needs are growing but resources are limited, AI offers the promise of greater efficiency. By automating routine, labor-intensive tasks (e.g. data entry, report writing, mapping), AI allows humanitarian staff to focus on high-level decision-making and direct engagement with communities<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. In short, AI’s ability to analyze vast data and generate insights in real time holds significant potential to strengthen humanitarian response and save lives.</p>
        <p>However, the embrace of AI also raises critical questions about safety and ethics in these sensitive environments. Humanitarian contexts involve vulnerable populations and high-stakes decisions, so any AI application must be handled with extreme care. As agencies experiment with AI, they face the challenge of aligning new technologies with core humanitarian principles (like humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence) and avoiding harm to the very people they aim to assist<a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a><a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a>. This brief explores the dual nature of AI in humanitarian action – its potential benefits and the attendant ethical risks – and examines current thinking on how to govern and use AI responsibly in these contexts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Benefits of AI in Humanitarian Contexts</h2>
        <p>AI has demonstrated a range of benefits that can significantly improve humanitarian efforts. Key advantages include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Warning and Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI can shift humanitarian action from a reactive mode to a more anticipatory approach. Machine learning models analyze weather patterns, conflict data, and other indicators to forecast crises like floods, droughts, disease outbreaks, or population displacements<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu" target="_blank">publichealth.jhu.edu</a>. For instance, AI-driven predictive analytics have been used to forecast natural disasters and refugee movements, enabling earlier interventions and preparedness measures<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu" target="_blank">publichealth.jhu.edu</a>. Such early warning systems help responders pre-position aid and mobilize resources before a disaster strikes, potentially mitigating impacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Resource Allocation and Logistics:</strong> In emergency operations, AI tools optimize how aid is distributed and where resources should be directed for maximum impact. Algorithms can quickly process satellite imagery, needs assessments, and supply chain data to guide decision-makers on allocating food, water, medical supplies, and personnel efficiently. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has leveraged AI to streamline its supply routes and identify more efficient ways of sourcing and delivering food assistance, reducing costs and time<a href="https://www.wfp.org" target="_blank">wfp.org</a>. By crunching large datasets, AI helps ensure that scarce humanitarian resources reach the communities that need them most, when they need them.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis for Situational Awareness:</strong> AI excels at extracting actionable information from big data sources (satellite images, aerial drone photos, social media, etc.) far faster than humans alone. This capability is transforming situational awareness in crises. For example, after a disaster, AI-powered image analysis can rapidly assess infrastructure damage or map affected populations. WFP’s SKAI platform (developed with Google) analyzes pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery to identify destroyed buildings, enabling responders to pinpoint hardest-hit areas within hours instead of weeks<a href="https://wfpinnovation.medium.com" target="_blank">wfpinnovation.medium.com</a><a href="https://technode.global" target="_blank">technode.global</a>. Likewise, AI-based text or audio analysis can sift through community feedback or field reports to detect emerging issues. Such data-driven insights allow humanitarian teams to make informed decisions quickly in fast-moving emergencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Communication and Accessibility:</strong> AI is also used to improve communication with and among crisis-affected communities. Chatbots and virtual assistants can provide people with timely information on assistance, rights, or services in multiple languages. For instance, the Norwegian Refugee Council, with tech partners, built an AI chatbot to help young refugees in Lebanon find education opportunities, tailoring guidance to individual needs<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. AI-driven translation and speech recognition tools help overcome language barriers in refugee camps or during disaster response. These applications enable two-way communication – not only broadcasting information but also collecting feedback – which can make aid more responsive and inclusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Across the board, AI can automate repetitive tasks and augment human workloads, increasing an organization’s capacity. Routine processes like data entry, form processing, and information management can be handled by AI, freeing up staff for more complex duties<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. A case in point is WFP’s “Meza” system, an AI-based OCR (optical character recognition) tool that digitizes handwritten nutrition clinic records from the field. By automating data collection from remote clinics, Meza significantly sped up analysis of malnutrition data and extended WFP’s reach into areas that were previously data dark<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. In general, such AI tools reduce manual workload, cut costs, and allow humanitarian operations to “achieve more with less” – a critical benefit in an era of constrained funding<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, these benefits illustrate why so many humanitarian agencies and donors are investing in AI solutions. When thoughtfully applied, AI has the potential to boost the speed, scale, and precision of humanitarian response<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu" target="_blank">publichealth.jhu.edu</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. From anticipating crises before they happen to optimizing life-saving interventions on the ground, AI-driven innovations can ultimately help aid organizations better protect and assist communities in need.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Ethical and Safety Risks of AI in Humanitarian Action</h2>
        <p>While AI offers powerful advantages, it also introduces significant safety, ethical, and governance risks in humanitarian contexts. If unchecked, these risks could undermine humanitarian principles or even harm the vulnerable populations that AI is meant to serve. Key concerns include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy and Protection:</strong> Humanitarian AI systems often rely on large volumes of personal and sensitive data (e.g. beneficiary information, displacement tracking, health records). In crisis zones, affected people may have little control over how their data is collected or used, raising serious privacy issues<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. A breach or misuse of such data could lead to severe consequences – for example, exposing refugees or conflict-affected civilians to targeting, stigmatization, or surveillance<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Informed consent is also a challenge; communities might not fully understand complex AI tools or their rights regarding data, potentially undermining trust<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Weak data security in disaster settings and the absence of robust data protection laws in many countries further compound the risk<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Protecting personal data and privacy is therefore paramount. Humanitarians must implement strict data governance, encryption, and anonymization measures, following frameworks like the ICRC’s Data Protection Handbook and OCHA’s Data Responsibility Guidelines that emphasize safeguarding vulnerable individuals’ data<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination:</strong> AI systems are only as good as the data and design behind them. If trained on biased or non-representative data, AI can perpetuate discrimination and inequity – a particularly dangerous outcome in humanitarian aid. Studies have found that some AI models have higher error rates for marginalized groups (for instance, facial recognition often misidentifies people with darker skin)<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. In humanitarian use, a biased AI could inadvertently skew assistance: e.g. predictive models might focus resources on areas with abundant data while neglecting “data-sparse” regions that are equally or more in need<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. The ICRC warns that algorithmic bias in tools like crisis analytics or vulnerability scoring can reinforce existing injustices, marginalizing certain groups or communities from aid<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. To mitigate bias, it’s crucial to use diverse training data, rigorously test AI outcomes for fairness, and include local context in model design. Human oversight is needed to ensure AI-driven decisions do not replicate historical prejudices or exclude those who are already underserved<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Transparency (“Black Box” Models):</strong> Many AI algorithms (especially advanced machine learning and deep learning models) operate as “black boxes” – their inner workings are opaque even to their creators. This opacity poses a challenge to accountability in humanitarian programs<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. If, for example, an AI system recommends prioritizing certain villages for aid, it may be hard to explain why those decisions were made or to validate that they are impartial. The humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence, and impartiality demand that aid not favor or exclude groups unjustifiably. But without transparency, hidden biases in AI could cause resource allocations that inadvertently favor some populations over others<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Moreover, when mistakes occur, the lack of explainability makes it difficult to determine who is responsible for AI-driven errors<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. This can erode accountability to affected communities. Ensuring a level of explainability – or at least clear human oversight and the ability to audit AI decisions – is essential so that humanitarian organizations can verify AI outcomes and maintain accountability for their actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Misuse by Malicious Actors:</strong> Tools developed for good can be co-opted for harm. There is growing alarm that AI capabilities could be misused by hostile actors (terrorist groups, rogue militaries, cyber-criminals, etc.) in crisis situations<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org" target="_blank">spectrum.ieee.org</a>. For instance, an AI system intended to coordinate aid deliveries could be hacked or fed false data to disrupt operations. Deepfakes and misinformation powered by AI might be used to create fake emergency messages or manipulate public opinion during conflicts. Researchers have even shown that a repurposed AI model can suggest tens of thousands of new chemical weapons in hours<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org" target="_blank">spectrum.ieee.org</a><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org" target="_blank">spectrum.ieee.org</a> – highlighting how easily peaceful AI applications might be twisted toward nefarious ends. Such malicious use of AI threatens not only individual crises but also international peace and security<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org" target="_blank">spectrum.ieee.org</a>. Humanitarian agencies must therefore treat AI security as part of AI safety: guarding systems against cyberattacks, vetting partners and software for security risks, and training staff to recognize AI-driven misinformation. Additionally, responsible AI initiatives need to broaden their scope to anticipate and prevent adversarial misuse, not just unintentional harms<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org" target="_blank">spectrum.ieee.org</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Accountability and Clear Governance:</strong> The introduction of AI can blur lines of accountability in humanitarian work. If an automated decision leads to a person being denied aid or a community being missed, who is accountable – the software developer, the algorithm, the field officer using it, or the agency? Without proper governance, there is a risk of a responsibility gap where negative outcomes slip through without redress. Moreover, many AI tools are developed by private tech companies or research labs; humanitarian organizations may become dependent on proprietary systems. This raises concerns about independence: reliance on external AI platforms could potentially allow outside influence over humanitarian decisions<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. It’s critical that agencies maintain control over critical decisions and have mechanisms to override or correct AI recommendations. To strengthen accountability, experts recommend measures like rigorous AI impact assessments before deployment, continuous monitoring of AI performance, and establishing clear protocols for human review and appeal in any AI-driven process. In sum, human accountability must remain central – AI should assist, not replace, human judgment when lives and rights are on the line.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In light of these risks, the humanitarian sector is increasingly urging a “Do No Harm” approach to AI, echoing the foundational ethic of humanitarian work<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu" target="_blank">publichealth.jhu.edu</a>. This means proactively identifying and mitigating risks (bias audits, data protection measures, community consultations) before and during AI deployment<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu" target="_blank">publichealth.jhu.edu</a>. It also means sometimes choosing not to use AI at all in particularly sensitive areas if the risks outweigh the benefits. As the next sections discuss, a variety of frameworks and guidelines are emerging to help practitioners navigate these challenges and use AI in a safe, ethical, and principled way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Frameworks and Guidelines for Responsible AI in Humanitarian Work</h2>
        <p>Governments, international bodies, and humanitarian organizations have begun establishing frameworks to ensure AI safety and ethics. These range from broad global principles to sector-specific guidelines. Key frameworks include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>United Nations and Multilateral Guidelines:</strong> The UN system emphasizes that AI deployment must be ethical, human-rights based, and aligned with UN values. In 2021, all UNESCO member states adopted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, a landmark agreement outlining principles like transparency, human oversight, non-discrimination, privacy, and accountability in AI<a href="https://unsceb.org" target="_blank">unsceb.org</a>. These principles (which include “do no harm,” fairness, safety, accountability, and inclusivity) now guide UN agencies in their use of AI<a href="https://unsceb.org" target="_blank">unsceb.org</a>. Building on this, the UN Chief Executives Board in 2022 endorsed a set of AI Ethics Principles for the UN System, committing UN humanitarian entities to uphold human dignity, avoid adverse impacts, and ensure AI is used only for defined, necessary, and proportionate purposes<a href="https://unsceb.org" target="_blank">unsceb.org</a>. At the global policy level, the UN Secretary-General has called for international guardrails on AI, and a High-Level Advisory Body on AI (whose 2024 report “Governing AI for Humanity” was released) has proposed a blueprint for inclusive global AI governance to address risks while sharing benefits<a href="https://sdg.iisd.org" target="_blank">sdg.iisd.org</a><a href="https://gp-digital.org" target="_blank">gp-digital.org</a>. Though broad in scope, these UN-led efforts provide an important ethical compass and push for international cooperation on AI standards, including in humanitarian action.</li>
            <li><strong>International Red Cross and Humanitarian Principles:</strong> The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the broader Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement stress that humanitarian principles must guide any use of AI. The ICRC has been active in research and advocacy around new technologies, from autonomous weapons to humanitarian data. In the humanitarian sector, ICRC experts argue that AI tools should be evaluated against the core principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. For example, impartiality requires that AI-driven aid allocation be based solely on needs, without bias – reinforcing the need to address algorithmic bias. Independence means humanitarian decisions (even when aided by AI) should not be unduly influenced by political or commercial interests – underscoring concerns about black-box models from third parties<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. To offer practical guidance, the ICRC (along with OCHA and others) has published resources like the Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action, which, among other issues, covers handling of personal data in algorithms, and warns against risks such as surveillance or misuse of humanitarian data<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Similarly, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) – the main coordination forum of UN and non-UN humanitarian agencies – issued Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action, which establishes principles for safely managing data (and by extension AI systems relying on that data) in field operations<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Although not AI-specific, these guidelines create a baseline for privacy, consent, and community engagement that any humanitarian AI project should follow. The message from humanitarian leaders is clear: AI must respect humanitarian ethics and “do no harm,” or it should not be deployed<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu" target="_blank">publichealth.jhu.edu</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>OECD Principles and Other International Standards:</strong> Beyond the humanitarian sphere, general AI ethics frameworks are influencing policy. The OECD AI Principles (adopted in 2019 by 42 countries, including all G20 nations) are a prominent example. They call for AI that is inclusive, transparent, robust, and accountable, and they specifically highlight the need to uphold human rights and democratic values in AI deployment<a href="https://www.oecd.org" target="_blank">oecd.org</a>. These principles have informed many national AI strategies and were even endorsed by the G20, reflecting global consensus on fundamental AI norms. Another key reference point is the UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics mentioned above, which is comprehensive and globally agreed. In addition, technical standardization bodies are weighing in: the ISO and IEC have begun developing AI management standards, and the IEEE has an initiative on ethically aligned AI. While these standards are not specific to humanitarian contexts, they provide a toolbox of best practices (for example, risk management processes, bias mitigation techniques, transparency measures) that humanitarian organizations can adopt to strengthen AI governance. Notably, some frameworks explicitly mention social impact – the IEEE’s ethics guidelines and the EU’s forthcoming AI Act both categorize certain AI applications that affect human welfare as “high-risk” and subject them to stricter oversight<a href="https://ansi.org" target="_blank">ansi.org</a><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu" target="_blank">digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu</a>. Humanitarian AI systems – which directly affect people’s rights, lives, and livelihoods – would likely fall into such high-risk categories, underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation and accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>National and Regional Regulations:</strong> A number of governments are developing regulations that, while not focused solely on humanitarian usage, will influence how AI is deployed in any sector. The European Union’s AI Act (expected to be finalized in 2024/2025) is a pioneering effort to legally regulate AI risks. It will require transparency, safety, and non-discrimination measures for high-risk AI systems, and it even bans certain AI practices deemed unacceptable (like social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance)<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu" target="_blank">digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu</a><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu" target="_blank">digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu</a>. If an NGO or UN agency operates in the EU or handles EU beneficiary data, these rules could apply. Other countries have published national AI ethics guidelines or strategies – for instance, the United States’ Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (2022) outlines protections such as data privacy, algorithmic discrimination safeguards, and explanations for automated decisions, which mirror the concerns in humanitarian AI. Several nations (China, Canada, UK, etc.) also have AI principles emphasizing safety and fairness. Furthermore, some regions are tailoring approaches for local context: the African Union approved a Data Policy Framework (2022) and is working on a continental AI strategy that includes ethical AI governance in line with African needs and values<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Though these national/regional policies vary, the trend is toward greater oversight of AI to ensure it is safe, rights-respecting, and transparent. Humanitarian organizations, which often operate across borders, will need to navigate this evolving regulatory patchwork. This may entail developing internal compliance regimes and partnering with governments to ensure that humanitarian AI tools meet legal standards without compromising humanitarian principles.</li>
            <li><strong>Humanitarian Sector Initiatives:</strong> Within the aid sector itself, there is a call for developing shared minimum standards or codes of conduct for AI in humanitarian action. Thought leaders suggest creating something akin to the Sphere Standards (which guide humanitarian practice) but for digital technology<a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a><a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a>. In 2023–2024, humanitarian networks have convened workshops and working groups on “AI in humanitarian action” (for example, at the Humanitarian Networks and Partnerships Weeks and through the CDAC Network), aiming to draft guidelines that embed humanitarian values into AI design and deployment<a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a><a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a>. While still in nascent stages, these efforts recognize that self-regulation and peer learning will be crucial. Tools like OCHA’s Peer Review Framework for Predictive Analytics in humanitarian response (developed by the Centre for Humanitarian Data) offer one model: it’s a framework to rigorously evaluate predictive models for ethics, accuracy, and utility before they are used in the field<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. Similarly, the ICRC and ICRC-hosted forums have proposed the idea of establishing “red lines” – areas where AI should not be used at all, such as in decisions that could threaten life if wrong<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. All these initiatives underscore a common point: collaboration and consensus-building are needed to ensure all humanitarian actors follow best practices for AI safety and ethics. A patchwork approach where each organization has its own rules may not be sufficient; hence the push for common standards or a manifesto for responsible humanitarian AI<a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a><a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, a robust framework for responsible AI in humanitarian contexts is emerging from multiple directions – international principles, legal regulations, and sector-specific guidelines. The challenge ahead is to translate these high-level principles into practical protocols on the ground. The next section will look at real-world cases that highlight both the opportunities and pitfalls of AI in humanitarian work, offering lessons to inform these frameworks.</p>

        <h2>Case Studies: AI Applications in Humanitarian Action (Successes and Lessons)</h2>
        <p>Real-world deployments of AI in humanitarian operations provide valuable insights into what works and what challenges arise. Below are several notable case studies, illustrating the diverse use of AI for good as well as lessons learned:</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x350?text=Pre-and-Post-Disaster+Satellite+Images" alt="Pre- and post-disaster satellite images of an urban area hit by flooding.">
            <figcaption>Figure: Pre- and post-disaster satellite images of an urban area hit by flooding. AI tools like WFP’s SKAI can analyze such imagery to automatically detect destroyed structures (highlighted in damage assessment outputs), enabling responders to prioritize worst-hit zones rapidly.</figcaption>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disaster Damage Assessment – WFP’s SKAI Platform:</strong> When a major disaster strikes, quickly determining the scope of damage is critical for effective response. Traditionally, analysts pore over satellite photos to map destroyed buildings – a process that can take weeks for large disasters<a href="https://unglobalpulse.org" target="_blank">unglobalpulse.org</a><a href="https://unglobalpulse.org" target="_blank">unglobalpulse.org</a>. The World Food Programme’s SKAI (Satellite-Knowledge AI) platform was built to turbocharge this task. Developed with Google Research, SKAI uses machine learning to compare pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery and automatically identify damaged structures<a href="https://wfpinnovation.medium.com" target="_blank">wfpinnovation.medium.com</a><a href="https://wfpinnovation.medium.com" target="_blank">wfpinnovation.medium.com</a>. It was tested on events like cyclones and earthquakes in 2022–2023, and the results are striking: SKAI enabled analysts to expand the area analyzed by a factor of 7 and cut the time to produce damage assessment reports by a factor of 6, bringing it under one day in many cases<a href="https://unglobalpulse.org" target="_blank">unglobalpulse.org</a><a href="https://unglobalpulse.org" target="_blank">unglobalpulse.org</a>. In one example, after the 2023 Türkiye earthquake, SKAI scanned 265,000 buildings across the affected region in just 24 hours – a task that would have taken human teams weeks<a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">linkedin.com</a>. By spotlighting the hardest-hit areas (through heatmaps and annotated images), SKAI helped responders target relief efforts to neighborhoods with the most destruction<a href="https://wfpinnovation.medium.com" target="_blank">wfpinnovation.medium.com</a><a href="https://wfpinnovation.medium.com" target="_blank">wfpinnovation.medium.com</a>. Success factors: SKAI’s open-source design and collaboration with humanitarian analysts ensured the tool met operational needs. It proved 13 times faster and 77% cheaper than manual methods for building damage assessment<a href="https://wfpinnovation.medium.com" target="_blank">wfpinnovation.medium.com</a>. Lesson learned: Even with AI, human expertise remains vital – SKAI augments (but doesn’t replace) UNOSAT image analysts, who validate and refine the AI’s findings<a href="https://unglobalpulse.org" target="_blank">unglobalpulse.org</a>. The case demonstrates how AI can save precious time in emergency response, provided it’s integrated with human workflows and rigorously validated.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Security Early Warning – HungerMap LIVE:</strong> HungerMap LIVE is an AI-powered hunger monitoring system developed by WFP to track and predict food insecurity in near real-time across over 90 countries<a href="https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu" target="_blank">knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu</a><a href="https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu" target="_blank">knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu</a>. It aggregates over a billion data points—from food prices and rainfall patterns to conflict events and nutrition surveys—and uses machine learning to forecast where hunger is likely to worsen<a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank">medium.com</a><a href="https://innovation.wfp.org" target="_blank">innovation.wfp.org</a>. This has allowed WFP and governments to anticipate famine risks and trigger early interventions. For example, in 2020–2021, HungerMap’s alerts helped mobilize aid in parts of the Sahel and East Africa before malnutrition rates spiked, thus preventing worse outcomes. Success factors: The platform blends AI predictions with human analyst oversight and local validation, which has improved its accuracy over time. It’s also publicly accessible, promoting transparency. Lesson learned: One challenge has been data disparities – some conflict zones have sparse data, which can make predictions less reliable<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. WFP addressed this by partnering with humanitarian organizations on the ground to fill information gaps, highlighting the importance of combining AI with community-level data gathering.</li>
            <li><strong>Refugee Support and Community Engagement – AI Chatbots:</strong> Humanitarian groups are experimenting with AI chatbots to improve how they communicate with and support people in need. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), for instance, piloted a chatbot in Lebanon (built with University College Dublin and Microsoft) to guide young Syrian refugees to education programs<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. The chatbot interacts in Arabic, answering questions and suggesting opportunities based on each user’s situation. Similarly, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has been developing a network of AI chatbots to disseminate information to displaced populations, aiming to reach 1.5 million people with personalized advice on topics like legal rights and healthcare<a href="https://techxplore.com" target="_blank">techxplore.com</a>. Successes: These AI assistants operate 24/7 and handle high volumes of inquiries, extending the reach of services without requiring equivalent staff increases. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, chatbots helped deliver reliable public health information in refugee camps when in-person services were limited. Lessons: Trust and accuracy are major considerations. NRC found that building trust required making the chatbot culturally sensitive and transparent about being an AI. Regular updates were needed to ensure information remained accurate and relevant. Another lesson is the importance of user feedback – refugees using the chatbot wanted the ability to ask follow-up questions and preferred when the system could connect them to a human if needed. This underscores that AI tools should augment, not replace, human humanitarian workers, and must be designed with user input to truly meet community needs<a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a><a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Analytics for Displacement – Project Jetson and Beyond:</strong> In complex emergencies, predicting population movements can greatly aid preparedness. UNHCR’s Project Jetson (launched in 2017 in Somalia) was an early attempt to use AI to forecast internal displacements caused by drought and conflict. It analyzed factors like weather, violence incidents, and market prices to output predictions of how many people might flee and to where. While innovative, Jetson faced challenges with data reliability and was eventually folded into broader predictive efforts. Building on such lessons, newer models like the Danish Refugee Council’s Global Displacement Forecast use open-source AI to project forced displacement in countries like Afghanistan and Myanmar, months in advance<a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a><a href="https://www.icrc.org" target="_blank">icrc.org</a>. These predictions (after validation) have been used to pre-position aid stocks and advocate for funding in expected hotspot areas. Successes: Some forecasts have proven uncannily accurate, giving humanitarian actors a head-start in responding (e.g. anticipating a surge of displaced people from a looming offensive, and arranging shelter and supplies beforehand). Lessons: Predictive models must contend with huge uncertainty in human behavior and conflict dynamics. False alarms or inaccurate predictions can occur, so agencies have learned to use these tools as one input among many, not as gospel. Importantly, involving analysts with contextual knowledge to interpret AI forecasts is critical – an algorithm might flag a high risk of displacement, but experts are needed to explain the social and political nuances and to design an appropriate response. This case highlights the need for transparency and human analytic oversight in AI – a “black box” prediction without explanation is of limited value to decision-makers on the ground.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Missteps – Data and Partnerships:</strong> Not all experiences have been smooth. A cautionary example arose from the WFP-Palantir partnership in 2019. WFP partnered with Palantir (a data analytics firm) to help analyze its beneficiary data and improve operational efficiency. However, the deal sparked an outcry among data privacy advocates, who feared that handing sensitive data on vulnerable populations to a private firm (notorious for intelligence and security contracts) could compromise the neutrality and trust of humanitarian data<a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org" target="_blank">thenewhumanitarian.org</a><a href="https://responsibledata.io" target="_blank">responsibledata.io</a>. An open letter from NGOs criticized the lack of transparency in the agreement and the potential risks if the data were misused<a href="https://responsibledata.io" target="_blank">responsibledata.io</a>. In response, WFP had to strengthen its data safeguards and be more transparent about how the data would be used (insisting that Palantir would not data-mine or share the information)<a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank">medium.com</a>. Lesson: This incident underscores that with great data comes great responsibility. Humanitarians must vet private sector partners carefully and ensure ironclad data protection agreements. The perception of doing “big data” or AI projects with firms that beneficiaries do not trust can itself damage the humanitarian organization’s reputation and relationship with the community. Therefore, beyond technical fixes, maintaining community trust through engagement and clear communication about how AI/data projects affect them is a vital lesson learned.</li>

        <p>In sum, these case studies demonstrate AI’s tangible benefits – faster disaster mapping, predictive aid allocation, scalable communication – while also revealing pitfalls around data, bias, and trust. Successful projects tended to combine cutting-edge technology with human oversight, local input, and iterative learning. Less successful ones often faltered due to rushing in without sufficient ethical guardrails or stakeholder co</p>
